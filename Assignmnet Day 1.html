    ‘A letter to God’ is a story of extreme faith in god. The writer had tried to depict the faith of a poor and simple farmer in god. 
    Lencho was an honest and  hard working farmer .
     Once there was a hailstorm. It destroyed his crop completely.
      Lencho had great faith to God. He asked God to send him money. 
      The postmaster saw the letter. He decided to help Lencho. 
      He collected some money. He put it inside the envelope. 
      Lencho came to the post office to check his mail. 
      The post office people gave him the envelope.

    Lencho opened the envelope. He took out the money and counted it.
        He found that it was less than he had asked for. 
        He wrote another letter to God.
         He asked God to send him  rest of the money.
          But he wanted God not to send the money through the mail.
           He considered them a bunch of crooks who had stolen thirty pesos from the hundred pesos sent by God.
